* Second sample test - Discrete mathematics 1.
1. How many ways can 10 prizes be awarded to 30 contestants, if
   1) The prizes are different, and the contestant get at most one
      prize;
   2) The prizes are different, and the contestants may receive more
      prizes;
   3) The prizes are the same, and the contestants get at most one
      prize;
   4) The prizes are the same, and the contestants may receive more
      prizes;
   5) How many ways can 10 prizes be divided among 5 contestants, if
      every one gets at least one prize and the prizes are the same?
2. How many ways can 10 small balls be placed in 100 numbered boxes,
   if
   1) the balls are also numbered;
   2) the balls are numbered, and in every non-empty box there has to
      be two of them;
   3) the balls are the same, and in every non-empty box there has to
      be two of them;
   4) the balls are the same, and they can not be placed in
      neighbouring boxes;
   5) the balls are numbered (form 1 to 10), and they have to be
      placed so the parity of the balls and the boxes has to be the
      same?
3. How many 100 digit numbers are there in the binary number system,
   where each digit appears at least once?  And how many in the
   decimal number system?
4. Solve the following congruences:
   1) $3x \equiv 4 \pmod{7}$;
   2) $2x \equiv 5 \pmod{14}$;
   3) $6x \equiv 4 \pmod{10}$;
   4) $34x \equiv 2 \pmod{55}$;
   5) $x^2 \equiv 3 \pmod{5}$.
5. What are the las to digits of $1789^{1969^{2013}}$ (in the decimal
   number system)? Justifie your answer.
6. 
   1) Solve the following (simultaneous) system of congruences:
      \begin{align*}
      x&\equiv 2 \pmod{5}\\
      x&\equiv 3 \pmod{6}\\
      x&\equiv 1 \pmod{7} 
      \end{align*}
