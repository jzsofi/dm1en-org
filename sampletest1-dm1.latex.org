1. Negate (logically) the following sentences (but not just by putting
   ``It is not true that'' before them):
   1. The line $e$ intersects the line $f$ , and it's perpendicular to
      $g$.
   2. Every red car has a black component.
   3. For every even integer $n$ greater than 10, there exist primes
      $p$ and $q$, so that $p+q=n$.
   4. If the degree of every vertex in a graph is even, then it
      contains an Euler line.
   5. For every thingy there is a gadgete which has only two coloured
      widgets.

2. Each of the following statements is either true for every set, or
   there are counter examples.  If the statement is not true for every
   set find sets for which it is NOT true (counter examples).
   1. $A\cup B = A\cap B$
   2. $(A\setminus B) \setminus C = A\setminus (B \setminus C)$
   3. $(A\cup B) \cup C = A \cup (B\cup C)$
   4. $(A\Delta B) \cup C = (A\cup C) \Delta (B\cup C)$
   5. $A \setminus (B \cup C) = A\cap \overline{B}\cap \overline{C}$

3. In a department store the set of workers doing restocking is:
   $X=\{Adam, Bob, Cecil\}$.  The set of departments: $Y=\{Bakery,
   Drinks, Sweets, Cashier\}$.  The products are Z = \{chocolate,
   cola, rolls, croissant \}$.  The following relation describes which
   worker is responsible for restocking which department: $R=\{(Adam,
   Bakery), (Adam, Drinks), (Bob, Cashier), (Cecil, Sweets)\}$.  The
   products can be found at the following departments (provided as a
   relation): $S= \{(chocolate, Sweets), (chocolate, Cashier), (cola,
   Drinks), (cola, Cashier), (rolls, Bakery), (croissant, Bakery),
   (croissant, Sweets)\}$.  Answer the following questions.
   1. What are the elements of the set: $R\circ S$.
   2. Which are functions: $R, R^{-1}, S, S^{-1}$?
   3. Let $R_2 = R|_{\{\textnormal{Adam}\}}$ What is
      $\textrm{rng}(S^{-1}\circ R_2)$?
   4. Using the relations $R$ and $S$, who can we formulate the query
      who is responsible for restocking chocolate?
   5. Is $R$ transitive?

4. Provided the following relation on the set $E$ of eight complex
   roots of unity $R = \{(x,y) \mid \exists k\in\mathbb{Z} \ (x^k = y)
   \}$.  Illustrate (draw) the relation using arrows, connecting the
   points of $E$.  Examine, if the relations i reflexive, symmetrical,
   transitive, anti-symmetrical?  Is the relation an equivalence
   relation?  If (and only if) it is, list all the equivalence
   classes.  Is it a partial ordering?  If (and only if) it is, list
   the minimal i.e. the maximal elements.

2. Calculate the rectangular form of the following numbers ($a$ and
   $b$ are non-zero real numbers):
   1. $(2+i)^2$; 
   2. $(a+3i)(b-2ai)$;
   3. $(1+i)(1-i)(-1+i)(-1-i)$;
   4. $1/(a+bi) + 1/(a-bi)$; 
   5. $i^{2013}$.
   
3. Using the polar form, calculate the value of $z$, both the polar
   and rectangular form, then give all complex values of $w$ in polar
   for, for which $w^6=z$ is true.
   \[ z = \frac{(2+2\sqrt{3}i)^{24}}{(-1+i)^{90}} \]
4. 
   1. Solve the following equation on the set of complex numbers:
      \[ (1+i)z^2 + (2+3i)z + (1+2i) = 0 \]
   2. What are the points dividing the PQ line segment into 3 equal
      segments, if $P = 2+3i$, $Q=-4+5i$.
