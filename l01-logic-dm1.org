* Basics
** Logic: The science of correct reasoning 
*** Definition
    - *Logic* (from the Ancient Greek: logike) is the use and study of
      *valid reasoning*.
    - Independently of the object of discussion.
    - Logic discusses *statements* which have a unique *truth value*.
*** Truth values
    - *Truth values* can be either *true* ($\uparrow$, 1, $\tru$) or
      *false* ($\downarrow$, 0, $\fls$).
    - $\mathbb{L}=\{\tru,\fls\}$.
    - *Propositional variables* are variables which range over truth
      values, (they must be either true or false, but never both).
* Zeroth-order logic
** Zeroth-order logic
*** Definition
    - In mathematical logic, a *propositional calculus* or *logic*
      (also called *sentential calculus* or *sentential logic*) is a
      formal system in which formulas of a formal language may be
      interpreted to represent propositions.
    - It is formal, \ie it uses (well-formed) formulas to approximate
      reality.
    - It deals only with statements which are either true or false
      (not both).
    - Mathematical logic does not address the contents of the
      statement, only it's truth-value.
    - Propositional logic discusses the properties and rules of
      logical operations.
** Domain of discourse
*** Definition
    - *The domain of discourse*, also called the *universe of
      discourse* (or simply *universe*),
    - is the set of entities over which certain variables of interest
      in some formal treatment may range.
    - It is the set of "things we are discussing".
    - Usually it is denoted by $U$
*** Examples
    - $U=$ the students in this class
    - $U=\N$
** Terms
*** Definition
    1) If $t\in U$ then $t$ is a *term*.
    2) If $f$ is an $n$-ary function symbol, and $t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_n$
       are terms, then $f(t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_n)$ is a *term*.
    3) *Every term* can be obtained by the finite application of the
       previous two rules.
*** Examples
    - $f(t)=$ the nearest student to $t$
    - $f(n,m)=n+m$ (note we can think of $+$ as a $+(\cdot,\cdot)$
      binary function
** Predicates 
*** Definition
    - A *predicate* takes an entity or entities in the *domain of
      discourse* as *input* and *outputs* either *True or False*.
    - $P$ is an $n$-ary predicate if $P:U^n\to \mathbb{L}$.
    - Predicates are statements about the entities of the domain of
      discourse.
*** Examples
    - $F(t)$: $t$ is female
    - $D(m,n)$: $m$ divides $n$
** COMMENT TODO Questions
*** Are these valid statements in formal logic?
    1) Two is larger.
    2) The car is fast.
    3) There is an even prime number.
#+BEAMER: \pause
*** Answers
    1) No, we can not determine the it's truth value.
    2) Yes, depends on the definition of /fast/.
    3) Yes, we even not that it is a true statement
** Logical operators
*** Definition
    - Logical operators are map of the form $\mathbb{L}^n \to
      \mathbb{L}$ (for some positive integer $n$).
    - They come from well-known everyday logical operations, \eg
      *and*, *or*, *if...then*, *if and only if*, *not*
    - They connect predicated \ie statements to form larger statements
*** Examples
    - Binary logical operators: $\land$ (and, conjunction), $\lor$ (/inclusive or, disjunction), 
      $\Rightarrow$ (if..then, implication), $\Leftrightarrow$ (if and only if, iff, equivalence).
    - Unary logical operator: $\lnot$ (not, negation)

** Remarks and Questions
*** Remarks
    - The variables $A$ and $B$ in the truth-tables above are
      propositional variables, \ie $A\in \mathbb{L}$ (and not $\in
      U$).
    - These propositional variables denote some predicates, \ie
      $A=P(t)$ or $B=D(m,n)$.
    - Note the distinction between the entities in the domain of
      discourse and the operations on them, versus the predicates (\ie
      statements) and the /logical operations/ connection them.
*** Questions
    - Is the following a valid statement, and is it true?
      - "If $1=2$ then I am the Pope!"
#+BEAMER: \pause
    - Yes, it is a valid statement. It is also true, because "false
      implies everything". (Check the truth-tables)
** Well-formed formulas
*** Definition
    1) If $P$ is a $n$-ary predicate, and $t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_n$ are
       terms, then $P(t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_n)$ is called an *atomic
       formula* and it is a well-formed formula.
    2) If $\A$ and $\B$ are well-formed formulas then $\A\land\B$,
       $\A\lor\B$, $\A\Rightarrow\B$, $\A\Leftrightarrow\B$ and
       $\lnot\A$ are also well-formed formulas.
    3) *Every well-formed formula* can be obtained by the finite
       application of the previous two rules.
*** Example
    - Both $F(x)$ and $F(y)$ are well-formed formulas,
    - Then $F(x)\lor F(y)$ and $(F(x)\land F(y) ) \Rightarrow F(y)$.
** Interpretation, Satisfiability, Validity
*** Definitions
    - An *interpretation* of a formula is an assignment of meaning to
      the variables in the formula, \ie substituting the variables
      with concrete values from $U$.
    - A formula is *satisfiable* if it is possible to find an
      interpretation which makes the formula true.
    - A formula is *valid* if all interpretations of the formula make
      it true.
    - Valid formulas are also called *tautologies* or rules.
    - The opposite concepts are *unsatisfiable* (always false) and
      *invalid* (some interpretations make it false).
** Interpretation, Satisfiability, Validity
*** Examples
    - Let $M(t)$ mean that $t$ is male (over the students of ELTE) and
      let $\A=M(x)\land M(y)$ be a formula.
    - Possible interpretations of $\A$ are:
      - The interpretation $\A(x/Attila,y/Istvan)$ yields $M(Attila)
        \land M(Istvan)$ which is true.
      - The interpretation $\A(x/Attila,y/Anna)$ yields $M(Attila)
        \land M(Anna)$ which is false.
    - $\A$ is *satisfiable*, because of the first interpretation.
    - $\A$ is *invalid*, because the second interpretation makes it
      false (\ie it is not always true).
    - $\B=M(x) \land M(y) \Rightarrow M(x)$ is a *valid formula*,
      because it is always true. It is a *tautology*.
    - $\lnot\B$ is an *unsatisfiable* fromula.
** Questions
*** Questions
    - For each of the bellow points determine if the statement or
      "vice versa" is true, or both or neither are true:
      - All satisfiable statements are valid formulas.
      - All satisfiable formulas are invalid.
      - Some satisfiable formulas are invalid.
      - All valid formulas are not unsatisfiable.

** Proof
*** Proof of $\A\land(\A \lor \B) \iff \A$
    Let $\mathcal{F}=\A\land(\A \lor \B) \iff \A$ and $lhs=\A\land(\A
    \lor \B)$ (left hand side), $rhs=\A$ (right hand side).

    If $\A=\fls$ then $lhs$ is false because of the definition of
    conjunction.  If $\A=\tru$ then $\A \lor \B$ is true because of
    the definition of disjunction, so $lhs$ is $\A\land\tru$ which is
    $\tru$. In both cases the $rhs$ equals $lhs$, so by the definition
    of equivalence the formula is always true, \ie valid.  $\qed$

    *Proof using truth-tables* is done by filling out the first two
    columns of the table as given bellow, and then the rest using the
    definitions of the logical operations:
    | $\A$   | $\B$   | $\A\lor\B$ | $lhs$  | $rhs$  | $\mathcal{F}$ |
    |        |        | <c>        | <c>    | <c>    |               |
    | $\tru$ | $\tru$ | $\tru$     | $\tru$ | $\tru$ | $\tru$        |
    | $\tru$ | $\fls$ | $\tru$     | $\tru$ | $\tru$ | $\tru$        |
    | $\fls$ | $\tru$ | $\tru$     | $\fls$ | $\fls$ | $\tru$        |
    | $\fls$ | $\fls$ | $\fls$     | $\fls$ | $\fls$ | $\tru$        |
* First-order logic
** Well-formed formulas
*** Definition
    1) If $P$ is a $n$-ary predicate, and $t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_n$ are
       terms, then $P(t_1,t_2,\ldots,t_n)$ is called an *atomic
       formula* and it is a well-formed formula.
    2) If $\A$ and $\B$ are well-formed formulas then $\A\land\B$,
       $\A\lor\B$, $\A\Rightarrow\B$, $\A\Leftrightarrow\B$ and
       $\lnot\A$ are also well-formed formulas.
    3) If $\A$ is a well-formed, $x$ a variable of the domain of
       discourse, then $\forall x\A$ and $\exists x\A$ are also
       well-formed formulas (these are *universally* and
       *existentially* quantified formulas)
    4) *Every well-formed formula* can be obtained by the finite
       application of the previous two rules.
** Examples
*** Example
    - Continuing with the example from propositional logic:
    - $\exists x F(x)$ and $\exists x\lnot F(y)$ are well-formed
      formulas.
    - $\forall x\exists y(F(x)\land \lnot F(y) )$.
** Quantifiers
*** Universal quantifier
    - Symbol: \forall
    - Read: for all, for each
    - $\forall x P(x,y) \iff P(x_1,y) \land P(x_2,y) \land \cdots$ (if
      $U=\{x_1,x_2,\ldots\}$)
*** Existential quantifier
    - Symbol: \exists
    - Read: exists, there is
    - $\exists x P(x,y) \iff P(x_1,y) \lor P(x_2,y) \lor \cdots$ (if
      $U=\{x_1,x_2,\ldots\}$)
    - $\exists! x$ denotes "there exists a *unique* $x$" or "there is
      exactly one $x$"
** Scope, Free and bound occurrences
*** Definition
    - If $Q$ is a quantifier ($\forall$ or $\exists$) and $x$ is a
      variable then the *scope* of $Q$ is the narrowest sub-formula
      after $Qx$.
    - All the occurrences of $x$ in the scope of $Q$ are *quantified*
      by $Q$.
    Let $\A$ be a formula and $x$ a variable, then
    - An occurrence of $x$ is a *free occurrence* if it is not
      quantified.
    - An occurrence of $x$ is a *bound occurrence* if it is
      quantified.
** Free and bound variables, closed and open formulas
*** Definitions
    - The variable $x$ is a *bound variable* in $\A$, if its every
      occurrence is bound.
    - The variable $x$ is a *free variable* in $\A$, if its every
      occurrence is free.
    - The variable $x$ has mixed occurrence if it has both free and
      bound occurrences.
    - The formula $\A$ is a *closed formula* (or a sentence) if all of
      its variables are bound.
    - The formula $\A$ is an *open formula* if it has at least one
    - The formula $\A$ is quantifierless if all of its variables are
      free.
** Examples
*** Examples
   - $\A= \forall x (P(x)\land Q(x,y))\Rightarrow \exists x \forall z
     R(x,y,z)$
   - The scope of the first universal quantifier is $(P(x)\land
     Q(x,y)$, the scope of the existential quantifier is $\forall z
     R(x,y,z)$, the scope of the second universal quantifier is
     $R(x,y,z)$.
   - The free variable is $y$
** Rules of first order logic
*** Rules
   1) $\lnot\forall x P(x) \iff \exists x \lnot P(x)$
   2) $\lnot\exists x P(x) \iff \forall x \lnot P(x)$
   3) $\forall x \forall y P(x,y) \iff \forall y \forall x P(x,y)$
   4) $\exists x \exists y P(x,y) \iff \exists y \exists x P(x,y)$
   5) $\exists x \forall y P(x,y) \Rightarrow \forall y \exists x P(x,y)$
*** Example to remember the last rule
    If $U=\{1,2\}$ then consider the following two formulas:
    - $\exists x \forall y (x=y)$ is false because it is: $\exists x
      (x=1 \land x=2)$ which is $(1=1\land 1=2) \lor (2=1\land 2=2)$
    - $\forall y \exists x (x=y)$ is true because it is: $\forall y
      (1=y \lor 2=y)$ which is $(1=1 \lor 2=1) \land (1=2 \lor 2=2)$
    - And by the definition of implication $\tru\Rightarrow\fls$ is
      false and $\fls \Rightarrow\tru$ is true.
* Theories
** Axioms,  theorems
*** Definition
    - *Axioms* (or postulates) are formulas in a theory which we
      consider *trivially true*.
    - *Theorems* are formulas *derived* from axioms using the rules of
      logic.
*** Example
    - In euclidean geometry one of the postulates (axioms) is: A
      straight line segment can be drawn joining any two points.  A
      theorem is that the sum of angles in a triangle is $\pi$ radians
      (or 180\textdegree)
